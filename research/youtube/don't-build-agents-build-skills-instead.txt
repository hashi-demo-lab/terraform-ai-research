summary:
Building an Agent Skill is less about "coding" an agent and more about structuring a filesystem that Claude can navigate. Technically, it is a progressive disclosure architecture designed to minimize token overhead while maximizing procedural reliability.Here is the technical breakdown of how Skills work under the hood.

📂 1. The Skill Anatomy (File Structure)A Skill is essentially a directory. The only hard requirement is a SKILL.md file, but a mature technical skill typically follows this structure:Bashmy-technical-skill/
├── SKILL.md             # Required: Entry point, metadata, and high-level logic
├── guidelines/          # Optional: Detailed markdown files (e.g., style-guide.md)
├── reference/           # Optional: Factual data (e.g., api-spec.json, schema.sql)
└── scripts/             # Optional: Deterministic tools (e.g., validator.py, formatter.sh)

🧠 2. The Three-Tier Loading Architecture
The most critical technical feature is Progressive Disclosure. This prevents "context bloat" by only loading what is needed at specific execution phases.

Tier,Component,Token Cost,When it Loads
Tier 1,YAML Metadata,~100 tokens,Startup: Only the name and description are injected into the system prompt.
Tier 2,Core Instructions,~1k–5k tokens,Triggered: The full body of SKILL.md is read via bash only when Claude decides to use the skill.
Tier 3,Resources & Code,Unlimited,Execution: Claude calls cat or python on specific files/scripts inside the folder as needed.

🛠️ 3. Technical Requirements & Runtime
To use Skills, the environment must support specific capabilities and beta headers:

Environment: Skills require a runtime with a filesystem and a bash/python execution tool.
Sandbox Constraints: * No Network Access: Scripts cannot call external APIs.Ephemeral Filesystem: Data doesn't persist between separate sessions (unless saved to a project directory).Timeout: Scripts typically have a 30-second execution limit.
API Beta Headers: If you are implementing this via the Anthropic API, you must include:code-execution-2025-08-25skills-2025-10-02

🔄 4. Skills vs. MCP (The Technical Difference)
It is common to confuse Skills with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), but they serve different technical roles:

MCP (Connectivity): Acts like a driver. It connects Claude to a live database or a remote API (e.g., Google Drive, Slack). It is functional and external.
Skills (Expertise): Acts like a manual or script. It tells Claude how to use those connections or how to perform a multi-step workflow. It is procedural and local to the agent's filesystem.
Technical Pattern: Developers are now using Skills to orchestrate MCP tools. A "Financial Auditor" Skill might contain the logic for when to call a "QuickBooks MCP" tool and how to format the resulting data into a specific Excel template.

📝 5. The SKILL.md FormatThe SKILL.md file must start with specific YAML frontmatter so the agent can "discover" it:Markdown---
name: doc-style-validator
description: Use this skill to check if Markdown documents follow the company's internal branding and technical writing standards.
---

# Document Style Validator
When this skill is active, you should:
1. Read the rules in `guidelines/branding.md`.
2. Run the `scripts/lint_check.py` to identify common errors.
3. Provide a summary of violations and suggested fixes.

## Examples
- "Check if this README matches our style guide."
- "Validate the formatting of the attached report."
