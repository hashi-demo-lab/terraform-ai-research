summary:
If you want to move toward the autonomous engineering flow Eno describes, here are the technical pillars you need to implement:

1. Rigorous Automated Validation
To enable an agent to work autonomously, your CI/CD pipeline must go beyond basic unit tests. You need:Highly Opinionated Linters: The rules must be so strict that the agent is forced to match the exact code style of your most senior engineers.Slop Tests: Specific tests designed to catch hallucinated logic or inefficient patterns common in AI-generated code.Visual/Front-end Regression: Using tools like Browserbase or computer-use agents to validate that UI changes don't break the user experience.

2. Specification-Driven Development
Traditional coding is: Understand -> Design -> Code -> Test. Agentic coding is: Define Constraints: Write the validation tests before the agent starts.Generate Solutions: The agent iterates until the tests pass.Verify & Iterate: Use "Plan Mode" or "Spec Mode" (like in Factory’s Droids) to ensure the logic aligns with intent before the first line of code is committed.

3. The agents.md Standard
the agents.md as an open standard. Technically, this is a file placed in the root of a repository that serves as a "handbook" for the AI.What it contains: Architecture overviews, specific "gotchas" in the codebase, instructions on how to run tests, and paths to important documentation.Why it matters: It provides the "contextual pointer" that prevents the agent from getting lost in a large-scale repository.

4. High-Integrity DocumentationOpenAPI Specs: Every API must be documented with a machine-readable spec.Type Safety: Moving toward strongly typed languages (TypeScript, Go, Rust) provides "free" validation that agents can use to self-correct during the coding process.

5. Remediation Workflows
Don't just use agents to write features. Use them to harden the environment:Task: "Identify every function in this repo with 0% test coverage and generate a basic unit test for it."Task: "Review our linter warnings and propose a new set of rules that would prevent these specific bugs in the future."
