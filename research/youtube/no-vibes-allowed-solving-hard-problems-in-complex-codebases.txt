💡 Key Technical Takeaways
1. The "Dumb Zone" & Context Management
The 40% Rule: LLM performance is not linear across the context window. Dex identifies a "Dumb Zone" that begins around 40% of the total token capacity (e.g., ~60k-70k tokens for a 168k window).

Performance Decay: Operating deep in the context window leads to poor tool calling, hallucinations, and "codebase churn" (reworking previous slop).

Statelessness & Trajectory: LLMs are stateless; they only know what is currently in the window. If the window contains a history of the human yelling at the AI for mistakes, the "trajectory" of the conversation likely leads to more mistakes.

2. Intentional Compaction (The RPI Loop)
To stay in the "Smart Zone," engineers must use Frequent Intentional Compaction—the process of taking large context dumps and compressing them into succinct Markdown summaries.

The workflow follows three distinct, compacted stages:

Research: Use sub-agents to "fork" new context windows to read files and understand code flow. The sub-agent returns only a succinct summary of relevant file paths and logic to the parent agent.

Plan: Compacting "intent." A plan should be a Markdown file with explicit steps and actual code snippets of proposed changes. This allows for human verification before execution.

Implement: The agent executes the plan using the compacted research and plan as its only context, ensuring high-leverage tokens are prioritized.

3. Progressive Disclosure of Context
Repo Onboarding: Putting a massive CONTEXT.md in a root directory is inefficient for large (5M+ line) monorepos because it fills the context window before work begins.

Sharding Context: Instead, "shard" documentation down the directory tree. Use a root file for global context and sub-directory files for local logic.

On-Demand Truth: Since documentation often lies, use agents to generate "On-Demand Compressed Context" by taking vertical slices of the actual source code truth at the moment the task starts.

4. Mental Alignment & Verification
Don't Outsource Thinking: AI amplifies the quality of the engineer's logic. If the "Research" is wrong, the "Implementation" is guaranteed to be "slop."

Plans as Code Review: In an AI-heavy workflow, human code review shifts from reading 1,000 lines of code to reviewing the Plan file. If the plan is verified by a human, the implementation becomes a "low-intelligence" commodity task for the AI.

⚙️ Technical Definitions
Term,Technical Meaning
Brownfield Codebase,"An existing, often messy, legacy codebase (e.g., 10-year-old Java) where AI typically struggles due to high ""noise"" and technical debt."
Context Engineering,The practice of optimizing what tokens enter the window to maximize correctness and minimize size.
Trajectory Optimization,"Starting a fresh context window once an agent gets stuck to remove the ""history of failure"" from the prompt."
Harness Engineering,Integrating specific codebase customisations and hooks into AI tools like Claude Code or Cursor.

🛠️ Implementation Strategy: The "RPI" Prompt System
Dex suggests that teams stop focusing on "better prompts" and start focusing on Workflows.

Stop: Long-running chat sessions that fill the buffer with trial-and-error logs.

Start: Moving human focus to the Research and Plan stages.

Execute: Treat the final code generation as "assembly"—the byproduct of a well-engineered plan.
